# DupeCheckGold104.3
I built this script to check if I song plays twice in one day to win money
It uses their api to find out what song is playing at the current point of time. 
After this it logs the song and time.
If it finds a match, it texts you.


Installation

Requires python 3.4+
Also requires following this to be install:
requests, json, time, datetime


Todo:
Comment code
Change it from text to pull bullet
Make it run only 6 to 6
Faster checks with proxies
